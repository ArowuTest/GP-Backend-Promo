# PostHog Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the PostHog integration with the MyNumba DonWin draw engine. The integration enables the draw engine to use PostHog as a data source for participant eligibility and cohort management.

## Architecture

The PostHog integration follows a layered architecture:

1. **PostHog Client Layer**: Handles direct communication with the PostHog API
2. **Cohort Management Layer**: Manages the creation and maintenance of participant cohorts
3. **Draw Data Source Layer**: Connects the draw engine to PostHog data

## Components

### PostHog Client

The PostHog client provides a Go interface to the PostHog API, handling:

- Authentication with API keys
- Cohort creation and management
- Person data retrieval
- Event tracking

```go
// Client represents a PostHog API client
type Client struct {
    apiKey     string
    projectID  string
    baseURL    string
    httpClient *http.Client
}

// Key methods:
// - CreateCohort: Creates a new cohort in PostHog
// - GetCohort: Retrieves a cohort by ID
// - ListCohorts: Lists all cohorts
// - GetCohortPersons: Retrieves all persons in a cohort
// - CaptureEvent: Sends an event to PostHog
```

### Cohort Generator

The Cohort Generator handles the creation and management of daily cohorts for draw eligibility:

```go
// CohortGenerator handles the creation and management of daily cohorts
type CohortGenerator struct {
    client *Client
}

// Key methods:
// - EnsureDailyCohort: Ensures a cohort exists for the specified date
// - GetCohortStats: Retrieves statistics for a cohort
// - CreateTestCohort: Creates a test cohort with sample data
```

### Draw Data Source

The Draw Data Source implements the interface required by the draw engine to fetch eligible participants:

```go
// PostHogDataSource implements the DrawDataSource interface
type PostHogDataSource struct {
    client          *Client
    cohortGenerator *CohortGenerator
}

// Key methods:
// - GetEligibleParticipants: Retrieves eligible participants for a specific date
// - GetParticipantEntries: Calculates the number of entries a participant has
// - RecordDrawResult: Records draw results in PostHog for analytics
```

## Configuration

The PostHog integration requires the following environment variables:

```
POSTHOG_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
POSTHOG_BASE_URL=<posthog-instance-url>
```

## Participant Eligibility

Participants are considered eligible for a draw if they meet the following criteria:

1. They have recharged before the draw date
2. They have at least 1 point (every â‚¦100 recharge = 1 point)
3. They are not blacklisted

These criteria are implemented as filters in the daily cohort creation process.

## Draw Execution Flow

1. The draw engine requests eligible participants for a specific date
2. The PostHog data source ensures a cohort exists for that date
3. Eligible participants are retrieved from the cohort
4. The draw engine executes the draw using the eligible participants
5. Draw results are recorded in PostHog for analytics

## Testing

The integration includes comprehensive unit and integration tests:

- Unit tests for the PostHog client, cohort generator, and data source
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation
- A test utility for manual verification

## Error Handling

The integration includes robust error handling:

- All API calls include proper error checking and context
- Errors are propagated with additional context for debugging
- Retry logic for transient failures

## Monitoring

The integration supports monitoring through:

- Event tracking for key operations
- Error logging with context
- Performance metrics for API calls

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored as environment variables, not in code
- HTTPS is used for all API communication
- Minimal permissions are required for the PostHog API key
- MSISDN data is masked in logs and displays
