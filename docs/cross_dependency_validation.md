# Cross-Dependency Validation Report

## Overview

This report documents the validation of cross-dependencies across all layers of the clean architecture implementation for the GP-Backend-Promo repository.

## Domain Layer Dependencies

- ✅ All domain entities are self-contained with minimal dependencies
- ✅ Repository interfaces are properly defined in the domain layer
- ✅ Domain-specific error types are consistently used
- ✅ No circular dependencies between domain entities
- ✅ No dependencies on external packages except standard library

## Application Layer Dependencies

- ✅ All use cases depend only on domain interfaces, not implementations
- ✅ Input/output DTOs are properly defined for each use case
- ✅ No direct dependencies on infrastructure or interface layers
- ✅ Consistent error handling and propagation
- ✅ No circular dependencies between use cases

## Infrastructure Layer Dependencies

- ✅ Repository implementations depend on domain interfaces
- ✅ External service integrations are properly abstracted
- ✅ Configuration management is centralized
- ✅ No direct dependencies on interface layer
- ✅ Database models are properly mapped to domain entities

## Interface Layer Dependencies

- ✅ Handlers depend only on application use cases, not domain or infrastructure
- ✅ Request/response DTOs are properly defined
- ✅ Middleware is properly integrated with handlers
- ✅ Router configuration is centralized
- ✅ No circular dependencies between handlers

## Import Path Consistency

- ✅ All import paths follow the same pattern
- ✅ No absolute imports within the same package
- ✅ No unused imports
- ✅ No duplicate imports

## Naming Convention Consistency

- ✅ All files follow the same naming convention
- ✅ All types follow the same naming convention
- ✅ All methods follow the same naming convention
- ✅ All variables follow the same naming convention
- ✅ All constants follow the same naming convention

## Code Structure Consistency

- ✅ All files follow the same structure
- ✅ All types follow the same structure
- ✅ All methods follow the same structure
- ✅ All error handling follows the same pattern
- ✅ All validation follows the same pattern

## Conclusion

The cross-dependency validation confirms that the clean architecture implementation follows proper dependency rules, with dependencies flowing inward from interface to application to domain, and infrastructure depending on domain. The codebase is well-structured, with consistent naming conventions, import paths, and code structure.

## Recommendations

1. **Dependency Injection**: Consider using a dependency injection container to simplify wiring
2. **Error Handling**: Consider implementing a more robust error handling mechanism
3. **Validation**: Consider implementing a more robust validation mechanism
4. **Logging**: Consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism
5. **Metrics**: Consider implementing a metrics collection mechanism
